# CRP Web API

CRP Network Web API, it'll provide all the core functionality required for customers, affiliates and administrators to use.

## Run API
Do `npm install` and then `npm start` and you'll get the service running on your localhost at port 3000. Soon we'll add a configuration file to add some customization, specially changing the port.

## Test it's working
You can test it by accessing http://localhost:3000/clients to see if it's working, it's merely a test page while we finish all the work.
